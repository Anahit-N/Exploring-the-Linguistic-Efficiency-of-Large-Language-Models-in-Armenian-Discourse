# Exploring-the-Linguistic-Efficiency-of-Large-Language-Models-in-Armenian-Discourse

This capstone project repository evaluates the performance of the GPT-3.5-Turbo model on Armenian discourse. It specifically addresses four tasks: 
- Extractive QA
- Multiple-Choice Questions
- Knowledge Access Question Answering
- Math Reasoning Problems

Each task is detailed within its corresponding Jupyter notebook.

Navigate to the respective Jupyter notebook for each task:
- `Extractive_QA.ipynb`
- `MC_Questions.ipynb`
- `Knowledge_Access.ipynb`
- `Math_problems.ipynb`

OpenAI API key is available in `api_key.txt`. All generated data is stored in the `Data` folder.
